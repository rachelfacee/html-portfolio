<h1>The Best Movies According to Rachel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ponyo</h3>
<P>I've loved this movie since I was a teen. And loved the storyline of a little princess goldfish breaking out of the constraints of her world and making her own path.</P>
<h3>Benjamin Buttom</h3>
<p>This movie is beautiful story of love and how time affects us all even if its backwards.</p>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>I love this disney classic cause of the relationship between all of the characters and how you make your own family.</p>
